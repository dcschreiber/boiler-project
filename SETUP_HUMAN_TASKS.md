### Step 4: Start Your App! üéâ

Make sure you added all the details to the .env.local file.

> - **Email**: The email you set as `ADMIN_EMAIL` in `.env.local`
> - **Password**: `ChangeMeNow123!` (temporary password - change it immediately!)

Then run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app is now running at:
- üåê Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- üîß Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- üìö API Docs: http://localhost:8000/api/docs

**First steps**:
1. Visit http://localhost:5173
2. **Use the pre-created admin account to login**:
   - **Email**: The email you set as `ADMIN_EMAIL` in `.env.local`
   - **Password**: `ChangeMeNow123!` (temporary password - change it immediately!)
3. You're now the admin! üëë

   SENTRY_DSN=https://backend-dsn@sentry.io/backend-id
   
   # Optional: Performance monitoring sample rate (0.0 to 1.0)
   SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1
   ```

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### "Missing environment variables" error
- Double-check your `.env.local` file exists in the project root
- Make sure there are no extra spaces or quotes around values

- Run `npm run validate-env` to see exactly what's missing

### "Cannot connect to Supabase"
- Verify your Supabase project is active
- Check that all three Supabase keys are correct
- Try regenerating the service key if needed

### Google sign-in not working
- Ensure redirect URIs match exactly (including http vs https)
- Check that Google provider is enabled in Supabase
